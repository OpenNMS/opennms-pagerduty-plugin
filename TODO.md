* Resiliency
   * Add retry handling & make a better effort of delivering events if sending fails
* Improved filtering
   * Make it easier for users to configure what alarms get forwarded
   * Add example for filtering on last event parm.
* Customizable mapping
   * Allow users to configure how alarms are mapped to incidents
* Complete webhook handling for bi-directional support
   * We should send an ack event out on ack
   * We have the hook reachable via /rest/pagerduty/hook, but the payloads are not handled yet
      * API registration can be tested via a GET to /rest/pagerduty/ping
* Improve support for handling situations
  * Should these be presented differently?
